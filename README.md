# Why Brubeck?

The team behind Brubeck mostly works in startups and need to express functionality quickly and safely.

If our ideas work, we can go back and make things more robust and, if we're smart, we haven't peed all over the code by the time we need to do this.  Developers trying to chase dreams know what we're talking about.

To us, technical debt is something that always happens, but the magnitude of it is what either kills us or gives us agility.

Brubeck aims to keep teams fast and lay the groundwork for compatibility with the robust systems that come later.


# Why "Brubeck"?

Dave Brubeck lived in Wilton, CT, where I (James) grew up.  He, or his son Chris, would play jazz for the students and exposed the students to music and its complicated components, like odd time signatures, at an early age.  I knew Take Five after my first year in Wilton.

Take Five is in 5/4 time, but many people who've heard it are not aware.  Our choice to use a concurrency system like gevent feels similar.  We like the way it puts the complexity of concurrency into a simple interface, much like how Take Five gave listeners the complex idea of 5/4 time in a simple melody.


# What?

There's plenty of room for help in the backend.  Think of Brubeck as part of the band.  It can speak HTTP or use ZeroMQ and putting SSH in the mix isn't that hard either, though it's not included by default.

We know there are lots of opinions out there and lots of people with the right way to do whatever.  We like to think we're just jamming too.

Brubeck's first line of code came from Brooklyn, NY, but it's current code base comes from around the world.

I'm moving as fast as I can!
